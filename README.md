## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based demo that simulates FIDO2 authentication using a YubiKey-like hardware security token. The demo showcases the interaction between a client (browser), a relying party (web service), and a YubiKey in a typical two-factor authentication (2FA) flow.

The demo implements the core cryptographic challenge-response system used in FIDO2. In this system, a user logs into a website with a username and password (1FA) and authenticates using a YubiKey (MFA). This README explains the project's major components, how to run the demo, and key features such as MFA management, YubiKey interactions, and phishing-resistant authentication.

### Key Features

- **FIDO2 MFA Usage Demo**: Demonstrates the phishing-resistant nature of FIDO2 by simulating both legitimate and phishing login attempts. The demo shows how authentication is successfully completed for the legitimate relying party while thwarting phishing attempts by detecting mismatches in the RP ID.
  
- **Cryptographic Challenge-Response**: The system uses YubiKey‚Äôs challenge-response mechanism to securely authenticate users by validating a signed challenge with the legitimate relying party.

- **Debug and Display Flags**: Explore detailed backend actions with flags like `-display_crypto_backend`, `-debug_mode`, `-debug_challenge`, and `-debug_yubikey`. These allow you to see cryptographic operations and even edit values during runtime to test different scenarios.
  
This overview, along with the included examples, will help you understand how FIDO2 and YubiKey technology works and why it's an effective defense against phishing attacks.

## FIDO2 MFA Usage Demo
##### The FIDO2 MFA Usage Demo is a comprehensive demonstration of how YubiKey and FIDO2 prevent phishing attacks by verifying the RelyingParty (RP) ID during the authentication process. This demo allows you to explore how authentication works when using a legitimate service (`login.microsoftonline.com`) and how phishing attempts from an attacker (`attacker.vm`) are thwarted.

### Steps to Run
1. Basic Run Command
To start the demo using the saved system state `presentation.dump`, run the following command:
   ```bash
   python3 demo.py -display_crypto_backend --launch-from-save saved_states/presentation.dump
   ```
This will load the saved state where two Relying Parties (`login.microsoftonline.com` and `attacker.vm`) are set up, along with predefined user accounts such as `PasswordOnly-User`, `LastPass-User`, and `Craig`.

2. Running with All Flags (`-all_flags` flag)
For a more detailed exploration, use the `-all_flags` to enable additional debug and display features. This runs the demo with all available flags:
   ```bash
   python3 demo.py -all_flags --launch-from-save saved_states/presentation.dump
   ```
* The `-all_flags` flag activates the following options:
   * `-display_crypto_backend`: Displays detailed information about actions completed by the cryptographic backend, helping users understand how the encryption and signing processes work.
   * `-fancy_display_location`: Displays RP name and username when login-context changes. Please note the text is large.
   * `-debug_mode`: Prints the value of all private keys at the runtime start, which is useful for those interested in the cryptographic details.
   * `-debug_challenge`: Allows you to edit the challenge values before they are sent to the YubiKey for authentication. This is especially useful for testing different scenarios, such as attempting to spoof the challenge from an incorrect Relying Party.
   * `-debug_yubikey`: Enables editing of the YubiKey‚Äôs internal values, giving the user more control over the authentication process.

These flags allow users to examine the authentication flow in depth and modify key components at runtime to simulate phishing attacks and RP mismatches.

## Demo Result
##### In the demo, you will observe how the system handles different login attempts:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è &nbsp;&nbsp; **Successful Login with a Password and Non-FIDO2 MFA**: 

For accounts like `PasswordOnly-User`, `AuthenticatorApp-User`, and `LastPass-User`, which only require a password or password and MFA in non-FIDO2 form, you will be able to log in on both `login.microsoftonline.com` and the phishing site `attacker.vm` which simply acts as a middle man between the client and the "real" RP (`login.microsoftonline.com`).

## üïµ &nbsp;&nbsp; **Failure of Phishing Attempts with Hardware-FIDO2 MFA**: 

For FIDO2-MFA-protected accounts like `Secure-User`, you will see that login works on `login.microsoftonline.com` but fails on `attacker.vm`. The `Client` will prevent the `YubiKey` from signing the `Challenge` from the phishing site, highlighting the phishing-resistant nature of FIDO2. Even if the `attacker.vm` changes the value of the `Relying Party` in the `Challenge` before passing it to the victim's `Client`, the `YubiKey` will then generate the wrong `Private Key` and incorrectly sign the `Challenge` leading to a decryption failure on the "real" `Relying Party` side. Blocking access to the attacker yet again.

## Exploring with `-debug_challenge` and `-debug_yubikey` Flags
1. `-debug_challenge`:
   1. This flag lets you intercept and edit the `Challenge` creation process before it is sent to the `YubiKey` for authentication.
   2. You can modify the values of the `Challenge`, such as the `RP ID`, to see how the `YubiKey` generates a `Private Key` and how the `Relying Party` responds when the `signature` does not match the legitimate site.
   3. This feature is especially useful if you want to simulate what happens when a `Challenge` is sent from a different `Relying Party` or user during runtime, giving you control over the authentication flow.
2. `-debug_yubikey`:
   1. With this flag, you can edit the values used inside the `YubiKey` itself. This lets you see how altering the `YubiKey`‚Äôs internal state would affect the authentication process.
   2. By modifying the `YubiKey`‚Äôs behavior or values during runtime, you can explore different security scenarios and understand how the `YubiKey` protects against tampered or incorrect inputs.

The [FIDO2 MFA Usage Demo](#-FIDO2-MFA-Usage-Demo) showcases the power of `YubiKey` (or other **hardware** security tokens) and `FIDO2` to protect against phishing attacks by preventing attestation `challenges` from unauthorized `Relying Parties`. By running the demo with the `-all_flags` flag and exploring the `-debug_challenge` and `-debug_yubikey` flags, you can see how the system detects and stops phishing attempts, even when credentials are stolen. This detailed exploration of `YubiKey`'s anti-phishing mechanisms highlights why FIDO2 is a robust and secure MFA method.

## How the Demo Works

1. Client Connection:
   1. The client connects to a relying party (e.g., login.microsoft.com).

2. Account Registration:
   1. The user creates a new account by providing a username and password.

3. MFA Registration:
   1. The user adds MFA to their account by registering a YubiKey.

4. Login Process:
   1. The user logs in with their username and password (1FA). If MFA is required, the system requests the insertion of the user's YubiKey.

5. Challenge Generation:
   1. The relying party generates a cryptographic challenge, which is sent to the YubiKey for signing.

6. Challenge Signing:
   1. The YubiKey signs the challenge using its private key, and the signed response is sent back to the relying party.

7. MFA Validation:
   1. The relying party verifies the signature. If it‚Äôs correct, the user is granted a session token and successfully logged in.
